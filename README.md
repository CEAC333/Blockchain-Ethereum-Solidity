### History

October 31, 2008 - Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
- "White paper" describing a system to allow peer to peer payments without a financial intermediary (like a bank)
- Cited transaction reversals as an issue with online commerce - the ability of customers to 'charge back' a purchase

December 2013 - Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform
- "White paper" discusses need for more programmatic control over transactions
- Wanted to enable creation of 'decentralized autonomous corporations' (DAC)
- Introduces the idea of 'Smart Contracts' as an entity that can send and receive currency, beyond just humans

### What is Ethereum?

- Ethereum networks are used to transfer money and store data
- There are many different Ethereum networks
- Networks are formed by one or more nodes
- Anyone can run a node
- Each node can contain a full copy of the blockchain
- The 'blockchain' is a database that stores a record of every transaction that has ever taken place

### Interfacing with Ethereum Networks

- Technologies For Developers -  web3.js
- Technologies For Consumers - Metamask, Mist Browser

### Metamask Setup

- Metamask for Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon
